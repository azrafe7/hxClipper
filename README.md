hxClipper
=========

Port of [Angus Johnson's Clipper lib v6.2.9](http://sourceforge.net/projects/polyclipping/) to haxe 3.1+

## Notes

 - Int64 feature has not been ported yet (as it requires an Int128 not currently available in haxe)
 - tests from the original code have also been ported. They're all passing, except the ones requiring 64bit Ints
